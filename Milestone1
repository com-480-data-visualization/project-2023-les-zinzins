Data cleaning / preprocessing : none ?

Problematic : 
- make a tool to choose economic vacations for tourists
- explore what features make a rent expensive
- Target audience : airbnb users / also owners to fix their prices ? Socio economics to study desertification?
- Main objectives : new ludic way to visualize these data, interactive

Basic stats : cf EDA
- distribution of prices (for a night ?)
- distribution of type of rooms
- distance of the good to city center
- average price per city weekdays vs weekends
- some stats about features

Already done : 
- some graphs like distance to center vs distance to metro
- a peu pres tous les graohes possibles + map --> trouver un angle bien orginal
